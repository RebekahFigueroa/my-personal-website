        <h4>Chemist | Product Manager | Software Engineering Student</h4>
        <p> 
          Hi, nice to meet you! I'm a chemist turned product manager who has been
      working in the product development space for over 6 years. I specialize
      in first-to-market launches with a focus in the consumer product goods
      space. I'm currently studying in a coding bootcamp to transition to a career as a software engineer. Curious to learn more about my journey? Check out what I've been up to below or feel free to reach out to chat!</p>

    <h3>A bit about me: </h3>
    <h4>
      I've been working in the product development space for over 6 years, making everything from shampoo to gummies to diffusers. 
      I fell in love with the science behind product development, specifically coming up with novel solutions to every day problems. 
      I love working on products that brighten someone's day and have a lot of pride for the products I've launched. 
      Curious to see what I've worked on? Take a look to the right!</h4>
      <h4>On a personal level, I'm currently located in Texas and enjoy cooking, video games, and sewing when I'm not coding!</h4>
